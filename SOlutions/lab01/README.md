# Lab 01

* Learn how to create, compile and run a java program from the command line
* Gain familiarity with Java development using VSCode IDE
* Learn the basic syntax of the Java Programming Language


## Lab 01 - Exercise - Average üî¢


1. Open the file `Average.java`. You will find a class named Average.
2. This class defines a method `computeAverage()` that takes in an array of integers and returns the average of this numbers.  You are required to implement this method.
  Hint:
   * To complete this task, you need to compute the sum of the numbers and the total number of elements
   * Use a `for` loop to traverse the list of numbers and compute the sum of the number.
   * Use `nums.length` to get the length of the array, after the sum has been computed.

3. Next, define a `main()` method.

    **Note**: Every Java application needs one class with a `main()` method. This class is the entry point for the Java application and is the class name passed to the `java`  command to run the application. The interpreter executes the code in the `main()` method when the program starts, and is the point from which all other classes and corresponding methods are invoked.

4. Inside the `main()` method, initialise an array of integers (you can just hard code the numbers in) and invoke the method `computeAverage()`, passing it as an argument

    **Hint**: `computeAverage()` is an instance method, hence you must create an instance of the class Average and invoke the method on this instance

5. Assign the result of this method to a variable and print the variable

## Lab 01 - Exercise - Splitter üçå

Modify `Splitter.java` in the examples package such that it reads from `System.in` a line consisting of words separated by a space and prints out the individual words in the string e.g.,

If the input was: `Help I'm trapped in a Java program`
The output should display as:

```
Help
I'm
trapped
in
a
Java
Program
```

Once completed commit and push your changes.

## Lab 01 - Exercise - Satellite üõ∞Ô∏è

A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. In this exercise, you will create an class that represents a satellite, and using this class create a series of Satellite object instances.

<img src='imgs/sat.jpg'/>

Satellites have the following attributes/characteristics:

* A `name` (String)
* A `height` in kilometres above the centre of the earth (integer)
* A `velocity` in metres per second (double)
* A `position`, which is an angle `Œ∏` in **degrees** of the satellite relative to the x-axis, anticlockwise. 
* All of the above attributes can be retrieved using a *getter* function and set using a *setter* function
* The position of the satellite can be retrieved in radians as well as degrees
* The angular velocity of the satellite, (radians per second) can be found as well as the linear velocity (metres per second)
* Given a length of time in seconds, the distance the satellite has travelled can be found.

You have been given a series of function definitions inside `src/satellite/Satellite.java`. Implement these functions according to the docstrings and above requirements.

Once you have done this, write a `main` method that does the following:
* Creates Satellite A, which is `10000 km` above the centre of the earth, with a velocity of `55` metres per second and at `Œ∏ = 122`.
* Creates Satellite B, which is `5438 km` above the centre of the earth, with a velocity of `234` **kilometres** per second and at `Œ∏ = 0`.
* Creates Satellite C, which is `9029 km` above the centre of the earth, with a velocity of `0` metres per second and at `Œ∏ = 284`.
* For Satellite A, print out `I am {name} at position {theta} degrees, {height} km above the centre of the earth and moving at a velocity of {velocity} metres per second`
* Change Satellite A's height to `9999`
* Change Satellite B's angle to `45`
* Change Satellite C's velocity to `36.5 mps`
* Print out Satellite A's position in radians
* Print out Satellite B's angular velocity
* Print out the distance Satellite C travels after 2 minutes.

### Expected Output

```
I am Satellite A at position 122.0 degrees, 10000 km above the centre of the earth and moving at a velocity of 55.0 metres per second
2.129301687433082
0.04303052592865024
4380.0
```

### Tips

1. You will need to store all of the attributes as fields in the class. This can be done above your constructor by declaring each field. For example:

```java
private String name;
```

You don't have to set the field to be any particular value (they will be `null` by default for objects, and `0` for primitive data types like integers).

2. In the constructor, initialise all of the fields to the parameters using the syntax:

```java
this.name = name;
```

3. You can convert between degrees and radians using `Math.toDegrees(theta)` and `Math.toRadians(theta)`.

4. The formula for conversion between linear and angular velocity is `linear velocity = radius * angular velocity` i.e. `angular velocity = linear velocity / radius`. Think about what the 'radius' is here!

## Lab 01 - Challenge Exercise - Pineapple on Piazza üçï

In this exercise you are going to (start to) implement your own forum! This week you'll complete a simplified version of the program that involves two classes interacting with one another.

We have designed an Object-Oriented solution to the following requirements, with class and function stubs in the `src/piazza` package. Your task is to implement the functions according to the specification.

**`Post`**

* At the moment, a post is just a string containing a message.

**`Thread`**

* A `Thread` is created with a title, and a first post;
* Posts can be added to the thread
* A `Thread` has a series of tags, which are just strings.  These tags should be retrieved in a sorted fashion (as per the documentation on `getTags`).

**`PiazzaForum`**

* The `PiazzaForum` contains a list of threads;
* Users can search for threads by tag;

### ArrayLists

In Java as well as Arrays, there are ArrayLists - objects akin to a list in python that store a collection of objects that can be dynamically added to and removed from. You can initialise an ArrayList using the following snippet:

```java
List<String> shoppingCart = new ArrayList<String>();
```

### Testing

We have provided a complete suite of tests for you. You will need the Java Test Runner installed to be able to run the JUnit tests.

You can run the tests by clicking on `PiazzaTest.java` in the VSCode project, and then clicking on `Run Test` under the test class or individual function. Don't worry too much about how these tests work for now - you just need to get them passing.

You can put in debugging print statements by using `System.err.println("message");`, and these can be viewed in the `Debug Console` on VSCode.
